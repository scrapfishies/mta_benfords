# Does MTA turnstile data follow Benford's Law? 

I recently learned about [**Benford's Law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) through the [Netflix series, Connected with Latif Nasser](https://www.netflix.com/title/81031737#:~:text=Digits&text=Latif%20explores%20a%20law%20of,and%20perhaps%20the%20entire%20universe.). Episode 4: 'Digits' explores how Benford's Law applies to music, social media, tax fraud, and more. It's a fun show and I'd highly recommend checking it out if you can!

A quick primer on Benford's Law from Wikipedia:

> **Benford's law**, also called the **Newcombâ€“Benford law**, the **law of anomalous numbers**, or the **first-digit law**, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. **The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small.** For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.

You can see Benford's illustrated in the figure below.

Since watching that episode, I'd had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to explore a dataset to check for *Benfordness*. 

I recently started [Metis' Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/) and our first project was to conduct some exploratory data analysis on [MTA Turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).

With the project behind me, I decided to dig a little more into the data and see how well the MTA turnstile data fit Benford's Law.

Check out [my blog post on Medium (coming soon!)]() and dig into my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/scrapfishies/mta_benfords/blob/master/mta_benfords.ipynb) where I explore the data. Feedback welcome!
